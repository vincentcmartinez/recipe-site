    <p>"Homemade salmon roll made with sushi rice, nori, and smoked salmon. This is 
        a very basic and easy recipe for making sushi. It might take a while to learn
         how to make a perfect roll, but you'll have fun trying! Add wasabi (Japanese horseradish) for a good kick!"</p>
    <p><em>Ingredients:</em></p>
    <ul>
        <em><li>2 cups Japanese sushi rice</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons rice wine vinegar</li>
        <li>6 sheets dry seaweed</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons wasabi paste</li>
        <li>8 oz. smoked salmon cut into long strips</li>
        <li>1 cucumber, peeled, sliced.</li>
        <li>1 avocado, peeled, pitted, sliced</li></em>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Instructions</em></p>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Soak rice for 4 hours. Drain rice and cook in a rice cooker with 2 cups of water. Rice must be slightly dry as vinegar will be added later.</p></li>
        <li><p>Immediately after rice is cooked, mix in rice wine vinegar; spread rice on a plate until completely cool.</p></li>
        <li><p>Place 1 sheet of seaweed on a bamboo mat; press a thin layer of cool rice on seaweed, leaving at least a 1/2 inch top and bottom edge of the seaweed uncovered. This is for easier sealing later. Dot some wasabi on rice; arrange smoked salmon, cucumber, and avocado on rice about 1 inch away from the bottom edge of seaweed.</p></li>
        <li><p>Slightly wet the top edge of seaweed; roll up tightly from the bottom to the top edge with the help of the bamboo mat. Cut salmon roll into 8 equal pieces and serve. Repeat for other rolls.</p></li>
    </ol>
